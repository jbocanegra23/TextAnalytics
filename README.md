Twitter Text Wordclouds

This code creates a simple process to reduce the steps of pulling tweet data, 
cleaning the text, and then creating a wordcloud for visualization all in a function that can 
be customizable within the function. 

Using Wordcloud2 there are more opportunities for customization. It is possible to consider
splitting this function into two steps. First cleaning the data into a simple 2 column data 
frame and then a function for the wordcloud.
